# What's This?

Git Highlighter shows you repos you might find interesting, based on your social graph on GitHub. This is great if you're looking for a new project, want to keep up with the latest tools, or just want to see what weird stuff people are building.

# Is It Live Yet?

[Sort of!](http://git-highlighter.herokuapp.com) It takes a few minutes for the app to generate recommendations, since it has to make a lot of client calls to GitHub and recommendations are custom-tailored to each user. I'm looking at ways to speed this up.

# Anything Else I Should Know?
