# What's This?

Git Highlighter shows you repos you might find interesting, based on your social graph on GitHub. This is great if you're looking for a new project, want to keep up with the latest tools, or just want to see what weird junk people are building.

# Is It Live Yet?

Nope! There are still important pieces that I need to build out before I can share this app with the world.

# Anything Else I Should Know? 

All code is released under the MIT License. 

If you want to add a feature or fix one of my horrible mistakes, just write some code, write some tests, and submit a pull request.
